# Meme-Me
Meme-Me is an app that allows users to create and share meme images.  The image used for the meme can either be taken using a camera attachment if available, or an stored in the photo album.  The meme editor enables users to add text near top and bottom layout margin.  The images are stored using core data and can be managed through a UITableView and UICollectionView.  Created memes can be shared using Apple's built-in UIActivityViewController.
